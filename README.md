# Stack Overflow in Recursive Function

This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error. The program contains a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. If the input number is too large, the program will exceed the maximum recursion depth and crash.

The solution to this problem is to rewrite the function using iteration instead of recursion. This will prevent the program from exceeding the maximum recursion depth and crashing. The solution has been provided in `bugSolution.hack`.
